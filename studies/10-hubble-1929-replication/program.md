# Program — 10-hubble-1929-replication

This is the living lab notebook. `study.yaml` is the machine contract;
`study_state.json`, `events.jsonl`, and `runs/E####/manifest.json` are generated audit
state and must not be hand-edited.

## Goal and track contract

- Goal: does Edwin Hubble's 1929 velocity–distance constant reproduce from the two
  tables his paper printed, and what do those 24 objects actually estimate?
- Kind `replicate` · modality `tabular` · profile `generic`. All three tracks are
  `mode: registered`: a run is a **cell**, its disposition is `measured` or `crash`,
  there is no incumbent, no headroom audit and no stop rule.

| Track | kind | Primary metric | Floor | Confirmation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `reproduction` | replicate | `targets_outside_tolerance` (lower) | waived: `exactness: exact`, resolution 1 target | `[sealed, replicate]` |
| `estimate` | estimate | `k_kms_per_mpc` (lower) | waived: `exactness: exact`, resolution 1e-6; MC resolution recorded as `fit_noise` | `[sealed, replicate]` |
| `simulate` | simulate | `coverage` (higher) | measured at Phase 0 (`sweep:coverage_floor`) | `[sealed, replicate]` |

Results are exploratory until each track's one sealed access confirms them and a
`reproduced: true` record exists for every development cell a confirmed claim cites.
A small delta without uncertainty is not described as real or decisive.

## Data and split

- Source: `bundled:hubble1929/hubble1929_table1.csv`; Table 2 resolved separately in
  `prepare.py` from `bundled:hubble1929/hubble1929_table2.csv`. Both digests on the
  data card; licence `datasets/hubble1929/DATA_LICENSE` (public domain).
- `split.kind: none` — the partition is the paper's own two tables, not a draw.
  Table 1 (24 rows) is the development block; Table 2 (22 rows) is sealed.
  `lib/hubble.py:load_block()` resolves `KLEIN_EVALUATION_KIND`, refuses the sealed
  block outside a `--final-test` run, honours `KLEIN_SEALED_DRYRUN`, and prints
  `split_fingerprint:`. Because `contract_split` cannot realize partitions for kind
  `none`, no realized fingerprints are registered and `run-one` prints
  `note: partition not verified` on every cell. That is disclosed, not hidden: the two
  block fingerprints are on the data card and a stranger recomputes them from the
  contract plus the bytes.
- The seal is a **prospective analysis lock**, not blindness — see
  `scouting_ledger.md` §0 and `study.yaml:sealed_lock`.

## Workflow

1. `klein gate record consult` (ack delegated — see the decision log below).
2. `prepare.py`, then `data_card.md` with a `Decision: GO`; record the DATA gate.
3. `method_card.md` + `references.yaml`; record the METHOD gate.
4. `klein preflight --study .` on branch `experiments/10-hubble-1929-replication`.
5. Per cell: write `analyze.py` for exactly that measurement, then
   `klein run-one --study . --track <track> --tests P# --description ...`.

Every candidate is committed before execution. On a registered track `run-one` always
restores `analyze.py` afterwards — the candidate commit IS the record of what ran.

## Decisions (append-only)

- **2026-09-03 — scaffolded.** `klein new --schema-version 3 --kind replicate
  --modality tabular --profile generic --split-kind none`, three registered tracks.
- **2026-09-03 — the gate acknowledgements for this exhibit study are DELEGATED to the
  driving agent by the lead.** Every gate is recorded with
  `--acknowledged-by lead-agent`; there is no separate human ack in the loop, and the
  referee reads this line. Phase acknowledgements are recorded the same way.
- **2026-09-03 — Decision: the sealed block is Table 2 and the seal is declared a
  prospective ANALYSIS lock, not blindness.** The driving agent had read all 22 rows
  before the contract existed (`scouting_ledger.md` §0/S6). What `study.yaml:sealed_lock`
  freezes is the statistic, the columns, the source of K and the tolerance; the access
  is spent once. Forced by: the exhibit's own honesty rule, and profile `generic` §7,
  which bans "blind" for this exact confusion.
- **2026-09-03 — Decision: a "fresh bootstrap block" seal is REJECTED before any run.**
  Resampling the same 46 rows an analyst has already seen creates no new information;
  calling the resample a holdout would launder a look into confirmation vocabulary.
  Recorded in `scouting_ledger.md` §Retirements and taught in `method_card.md` §4.
- **2026-09-03 — Decision: Table 2's `r_mpc`, `vs_kms` and `M_t` are forbidden to every
  cell.** `r_mpc` there was computed *from* velocity with Hubble's adopted K ≈ 500
  (dataset README; spot-checked at design time, S7), so it cannot be evidence about K;
  `vs_kms` is tied to it by an exact identity; `M_t` is the printed answer. Mechanized
  as leakage row 1 at the DATA gate.
- **2026-09-03 — Decision: catalogue coordinates for the solar-motion refit will NOT be
  fetched.** Twenty-four hand-transcribed sky positions at an epoch the paper does not
  state is a fabrication risk, not a replication. P2 is registered with an
  `inconclusive_if` on input availability and the missing inputs become the finding.
- **2026-09-03 — Decision: three sealed accesses, one per track, not one for the
  study.** `references/inquiry-model.md` defines "sealed" per KIND, and this study
  carries three kinds: `replicate` seals the original's reported value (Table 2),
  `estimate` seals a once-only comparison against an external reference (H₀ = 70),
  `simulate` seals a fresh seed block. The launch brief sketched a single sealed cell;
  where a brief and a protocol disagree, the protocol wins.
- **2026-09-03 — Decision: `exactness: exact` on the `reproduction` and `estimate`
  tracks; a measured floor only on `simulate`.** Every cell of the first two is a
  closed-form computation over a fixed printed table, so a k-seed spread would measure
  floating-point dust, which `klein preflight` already recognises as a waiver. The part
  of the estimate track that *does* move with a seed — the bootstrap-derived printed
  keys P4 and P5 read — gets its own Phase-0 measurement, recorded as `fit_noise`
  (provenance) and never as a bar.

- **2026-09-03 — Decision (contract re-record #1): `data.source` carries a tag, not prose.**
  The launch brief asked for
  `bundled:hubble1929/hubble1929_table1.csv (Table 2 via a second resolve ... )`.
  `data.source` is machine-resolvable (`references/data-sources.md`): with the
  parenthetical attached, `klein doctor --study` reported
  `[WARN] data source: ... no file 'hubble1929_table1.csv (Table 2 via ...)'`.
  Where a brief and a protocol disagree, the protocol wins. `data.source` is now the
  bare tag and the second bundled member is declared beside it as
  `data.source_table2`, so BOTH files are named in the hashed contract and
  `prepare.py` resolves both from the contract rather than hardcoding a path. Both
  digests go on the data card, as the brief intended. Made before any evidence
  exists; the CONSULT gate is re-recorded with this reason.

- **2026-09-03 — Decision (contract re-record #2): phase ids follow the shipped
  convention `adaptive-N` / `confirmation`.** The descriptive ids drafted at CONSULT
  (`p0-anchor`, `p1-reproduction`, …) made `klein preflight` fail
  `[FAIL] phase ladder: state current_phase 'adaptive-1' is not in the contract's
  phases` — `klein new` writes `current_phase` from the SCAFFOLD's first phase, and
  the guard against retroactively rewriting a phase ladder then fires. The guard is
  correct and studies 03 and 05–09 all use `adaptive-N`; the rename was the
  deviation, so the contract now matches the convention and the descriptions carry
  the meaning. Made before any evidence exists; the CONSULT gate is re-recorded.

## Phase slates

At every phase start, run the slate ritual (references/phase-ritual.md):
propose 4-6 falsifiable candidates, score novelty / testability / expected
information 1-3, record the table and the chosen candidate here, and mirror
the ranked survivors into playbook.md "Next-best candidates".
